  como_funciona_info: 'DECKTRACKER "listens" for communication patterns during the match, identifying which cards have been revealed. Therefore, as the cards are bought by you or are revealed by the opponent they are counted. Note that it is not possible to know in any case which card the opponent bought until it is revealed. Even if it were possible, we would not reveal it to you :)',

  experimental_info: 'As we have said, DECKTRACKER looks for network communication patterns while playing FAERIA. In this way, if the FAERIA is rebuilt or the pattern is modified, DECKTRACKER will not work. Also, newly released cards will not be listed. Well, we need some Yaks to help update DECKTRACKER frequently. You can collaborate by reporting bugs on the Discord Channel <a href="https://discord.gg/R5g3PwW"> #card17 </a>',
